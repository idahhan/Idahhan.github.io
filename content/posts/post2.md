# Why does org structure matter to a Product Manager?

Let's chat about why the setup of your company is super important for Product Managers, and bring Conway's Law into the mix. Picture this: back in 1967, Melvin E. Conway came up with this cool idea that the stuff we create tends to look a lot like how we talk to each other at work. So, if your company is all about working in separate little bubbles, chances are, your products are going to show that separation too.

For Product Managers, getting a handle on how your company is organized is like finding the magic sauce that makes it possible to whip up amazing products that don't just do well, but also fit perfectly with what you're aiming to achieve. This way of thinking helps shift the blame from people to the bigger picture, highlighting these issues as something built into the way things are set up.

# Why now? 

"Efficiency Reloaded" is the buzz for 2024. Picture this: McKinsey's "The State of Organization 2023 report" finds a third of leaders eyeing efficiency as a top goal. They've linked clear roles to better accountability, a key to scoring high on the Organizational Health Index. What's the ripple effect? A shift towards leaner teams and flatter hierarchies. Looks like it's all about cutting the fat and keeping it sleek in the corporate world.

Skipping the deep dive into every org structure out there, let's cut straight to a summary of key problems and how they might tie back to the way organizations are shaped.

 |       Problem       |      Possible Root Cause     |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|
|Slow decision making from Directors.|Dual authority relationships and a balanced power dynamic between product management and functional areas can lead to decision paralysis if they are not aligned under a single strategy.|
|Top management drawn into day-to-day decisions, limiting strategic time|	Increased volume of new products and rapid technology changes, or,  Inadequate delegation of authority, or,  Decision paralysis due to lack of alignment on strategy between product management and functional areas.|
|Decision quality concerns at lower levels and morale issues among technical staff.|Increased joint decisions at low levels not always aligned with company interests, or,  Technical staff dissatisfaction with non-technical roles.|
|Increased need for coordination|	Growing complexity in products necessitating more cross-functional decisions, or,  Growing number of products requiring more cross-functional decisions, or, Monolith product teams with no clear distinctions in team topologies (Streams, platform, enabling, complicated subsystem).

|Difficulty in managing diverse and rapidly changing product lines|	No product teams; the diversity and pace of change exceed the information processing capacity of general and functional managers.|
|Product teams failing to create certain technical capabilities internally. |PProduct teams operating on tight schedules often lack the time to develop technical capabilities. This underscores the need for specialized platform or complex subsystem teams. [Learn  More](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts-content/team-interaction-modeling-with-team-topologies)|
