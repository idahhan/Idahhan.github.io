<p>To understand why organizational structure matters so much for Product Managers, let&rsquo;s dive into Conway&rsquo;s Law. Imagine this: in 1967, Melvin E. Conway introduced the groundbreaking concept that the systems we develop often mirror our company&rsquo;s communication structures. This implies that if your organization is siloed, it&rsquo;s likely your products will reflect those silos.</p>
<p>For Product Managers, deciphering your organization&rsquo;s structure is akin to discovering the secret ingredient that enables the creation of outstanding products that are not only successful but also strategically aligned. This insight shifts the perspective from attributing silo issues to individuals, to understanding them as structural challenges.</p>
<h1 id="why-now">Why now?</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Efficiency Reloaded&rdquo; is the buzz for 2024. Picture this: McKinsey&rsquo;s &ldquo;The State of Organization 2023 report&rdquo; finds a third of leaders eyeing efficiency as a top goal. They&rsquo;ve linked clear roles to better accountability, a key to scoring high on the Organizational Health Index. What&rsquo;s the ripple effect? A shift towards leaner teams and flatter hierarchies. Looks like it&rsquo;s all about cutting the fat and keeping it sleek in the corporate world.</p>
<p>Skipping the deep dive into every org structure out there, let&rsquo;s cut straight to a summary of key problems and how they might tie back to the way organizations are shaped.</p>
