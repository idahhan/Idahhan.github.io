<h1 id="why-does-org-structure-matter-to-a-product-manager">Why does org structure matter to a Product Manager?</h1>
<p>Exploring the significance of organizational structure for Product Managers leads us to a fascinating concept known as Conway&rsquo;s Law. In 1967, Melvin E. Conway introduced a groundbreaking idea: the systems we develop often mirror our company&rsquo;s communication patterns. This means if your organization operates in isolated silos, it&rsquo;s likely that your products will reflect those divisions.</p>
<h1 id="why-now">Why now?</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Efficiency Reloaded&rdquo; is the buzz for 2024. Picture this: McKinsey&rsquo;s &ldquo;The State of Organization 2023 report&rdquo; finds a third of leaders eyeing efficiency as a top goal. They&rsquo;ve linked clear roles to better accountability, a key to scoring high on the Organizational Health Index. What&rsquo;s the ripple effect? A shift towards leaner teams and flatter hierarchies. Looks like it&rsquo;s all about cutting the fat and keeping it sleek in the corporate world.</p>
<p>Skipping the deep dive into every org structure out there, let&rsquo;s cut straight to a summary of key problems and how they might tie back to the way organizations are shaped.</p>

<td style="text-align:left">Slow decision making from Directors.</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Dual authority relationships and a balanced power dynamic between product management and functional areas can lead to decision paralysis if they are not aligned under a single strategy.</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Product teams operating on tight schedules often lack the time to develop technical capabilities.
