			<p>Welcome! I&rsquo;m Rami Dahhan, a Technical Product Manager with a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to craft long-term product roadmaps. With over a decade of experience at leading corporations like Starbucks, Rogers, and Bell, I specialize in aligning product development with strategic business goals, ensuring every feature we introduce is user-centric and backed by solid data.</p>
<p>My academic background, with a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Engineering and a Master&rsquo;s in Technology Innovation Management, laid the foundation for my approach to product management: rigorous, analytical, and always forward-looking. I&rsquo;ve applied these principles in roles ranging from co-founding Precio, where we developed innovative retail solutions, to leading product teams at Bell Communications, focusing on creating products that not only meet today&rsquo;s needs but also anticipate future trends.</p>
<p>As a Sr. Technical Product Manager at Bell and a Staff Product Manager at Rogers, I&rsquo;ve excelled in building roadmaps that guide products from concept through to delivery, ensuring they adhere to stringent standards like NIST and ISO. My commitment to a data-driven approach has significantly enhanced workflows and customer satisfaction, showcasing the power of informed decision-making in the tech industry.</p>
<p>I believe in the importance of continuous learning and professional development, as demonstrated by my certifications in PMP and Six Sigma and my studies at The Odin Project. My journey is characterized by a relentless pursuit of excellence, a deep commitment to innovation, and a drive to create impactful technological solutions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s connect and explore how we can use data-driven strategies and long-term vision to achieve groundbreaking results together.</p>
